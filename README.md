Notes CLI command to add, delete, filter, and list all notes.

```
Make sure to create a symbolic link to your CLI

```
$ npm link  # from inside the directory that the file lives in.
It takes a CLI and installs it inside the bin folder
$ which node
$ which note 
../../bin/note
All cli's live inside the /bin folder

The package.json has "type": "module", which let's you use modules in the ES6 way.
and it has "bin": { "note": "./index.js" }, which `note` is the the name of the cli command 
and it points to index.js. You want the name of the cli command to be a globally unique name.

```
## Added the shebang to index.js to let it what enviroment to run it one in this case node.

#!/usr/bin/env node

nvm use 18.0.0
